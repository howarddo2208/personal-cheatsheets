# security questions
just lie and create store fake QA for later use

# when going away from the computer
lock the screen

# biometrics, fingerprint
not that secure, many government requires you to forfeit the fingerprint, but not password. So avoid it
avoid using at airports, protest, etc -> reboot the phone so that it require password only

# phone lock pattern
do not use it, easy for people to memorize from a single view

# 2FA, 2 factor authentication
avoid SMS 2FA
use FOSS 1 time password generator with no sync and connection to internet like andOTP on android
can use physical authenticator like yubikey or turn an usb into one.
